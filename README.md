# PapaLouieSim
So far this just sets up my attempts to reverse engineer customer generation in the Papa Louie game series in C++
This so far only generates customers randomly, with "Closers" (special extra picky customers) appearing at the very end
of each randomly generated list.

The customer database is based off of the customer list for Papa's Pastaria
Currently this project does not account for customer's favorite holidays, or their orders.
